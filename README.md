# Challenges

Welcome to the `challenges` repository! This is a collection of programming challenges designed to be both fun and intellectually stimulating. The primary goal of this repository is to explore the diverse approaches to solving the same problem, highlighting the richness and flexibility of programming.

## About

In this repository, you will find a new challenge every few days. The challenge would usually be tackled either in R or Python, two powerful programming languages widely used in data science and analytics.

## How to Participate


1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of this repository so you can work on the challenge independently.

2. **Solve the Challenge**: Use R or Python to solve the challenge. Focus on readability, efficiency, and innovative solutions.

3. **Share Your Solution**: Once you've solved the challenge, commit your solution to your forked repository. Feel free to add comments explaining your approach and thought process.

4. **Pull Request for Review**: If you'd like to have your solution reviewed and possibly merged into the main repository, submit a pull request. This step is optional but encouraged for community learning and interaction.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality**: Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code. This helps others understand your approach and learn from your solution.

- **Feedback**: Constructive feedback is always welcome. If you're reviewing someone else's solution, be respectful and supportive.
